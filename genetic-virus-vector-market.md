<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Genetic Virus Vector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retroviral Vectors</li><li>Adenoviral Vectors</li><li>Adeno-Associated Viral Vectors</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Genetic virus vectors are used in gene therapy to deliver genetic material into target cells. Retroviral vectors integrate into the host genome, adenoviral vectors stay in the nucleus but do not integrate, and adeno-associated viral vectors persist in the host cell without integrating. These vectors have different capabilities and limitations in terms of transgene expression and safety. Other types of vectors, such as lentiviral vectors and herpes simplex virus vectors, also play a role in gene therapy research and are being developed for specific applications in treating genetic disorders.</p></p>
