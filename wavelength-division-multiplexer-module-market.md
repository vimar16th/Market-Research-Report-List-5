<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wavelength Division Multiplexer Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CWDM</li><li>DWDM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM) modules are used in fiber optic communication networks to combine multiple optical signals into a single fiber. There are two main types of WDM modules - Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexer (CWDM) and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexer (DWDM). CWDM modules operate with a wider spacing of wavelengths, typically up to 18 channels, while DWDM modules use tighter spacing and can support up to hundreds of channels. CWDM is more cost-effective for shorter distances, while DWDM is preferred for long-haul and high-capacity applications.</p></p>
