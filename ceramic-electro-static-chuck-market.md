<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic Electro Static Chuck Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coulomb Type</li><li>Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ceramic Electro Static Chuck (ESC) market is divided into two main types - Coulomb Type and Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) Type. Coulomb Type ESC utilizes electrostatic force for wafer holding, creating a direct attraction between the chuck and the wafer. On the other hand, JR Type ESC uses a combination of Coulomb force and Van der Waals force to achieve better stability and reliability. Coulomb Type ESC is more commonly used due to its simple design and cost-effectiveness, while JR Type ESC is preferred for its higher precision and control.</p></p>
