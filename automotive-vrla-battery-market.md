<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive VRLA Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AGM Battery</li><li>Gel Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive VRLA batteries are commonly divided into two types: AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) batteries and Gel batteries. AGM batteries use a fibreglass mat to absorb the electrolyte solution, providing high power and durability. Gel batteries, on the other hand, use a gel electrolyte that is immobilised within the battery, making them more durable and resistant to vibration. Both types offer unique advantages for automotive applications, with AGM batteries excelling in high-power situations and Gel batteries being more suited for deep-cycle use.</p></p>
