<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-absorbable Bone Screw Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Threaded Screws</li><li>Partially Threaded Screws</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bio-absorbable bone screws are used in orthopedic surgeries for fixing bones in place. There are two main types of bio-absorbable bone screws: fully threaded screws and partially threaded screws. Fully threaded screws have threads that run along the entire length of the screw, providing better stability and fixation. Partially threaded screws have threads that only cover a portion of the screw, allowing for better compression at the bone interface. Both types of screws are gradually absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for removal surgery.</p></p>
