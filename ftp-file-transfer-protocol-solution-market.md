<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active mode</li><li>Passive mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>FTP solutions come in two types of market modes: Active and Passive. In Active mode, the client initiates a connection to the server and specifies the port for data transfer. In Passive mode, the server opens a port for data transfer and the client connects to that port. Active mode is preferred for security concerns and simplicity, while Passive mode is used for compatibility with firewalls and NAT devices. Both modes have their own advantages and are used based on specific requirements.</p></p>
