<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Solar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied Solar System</li><li>Off Grid Solar System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grid-Tied Solar System refers to a setup where solar panels are connected to the local utility grid. Excess energy generated by the panels can be fed back into the grid in exchange for credits or payments. This system is common in urban areas where homes are already connected to the grid. On the other hand, Off-Grid Solar System operates independently from the grid, storing excess energy in batteries for nighttime or cloudy day use. This setup is popular in remote areas without access to the utility grid.</p></p>
