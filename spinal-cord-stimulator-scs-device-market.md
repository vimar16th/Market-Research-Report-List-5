<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable</li><li>Non-implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) Device market is divided into two main types: implantable and non-implantable. Implantable SCS devices are surgically placed under the skin to deliver electrical stimulation to the spinal cord, providing pain relief for patients with chronic pain conditions. Non-implantable SCS devices, on the other hand, are external devices that can be worn on the body to provide temporary pain relief without the need for surgery. Both types offer effective pain management solutions for patients seeking alternatives to traditional medication.</p></p>
