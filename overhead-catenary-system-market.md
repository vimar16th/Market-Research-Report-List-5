<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overhead Catenary System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flexible Overhead Catenary System</li><li>Rigid Overhead Catenary System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Overhead Catenary System market can be divided into two main types: Flexible and Rigid systems. Flexible systems utilize a more elastic material for the overhead catenary wires, allowing for greater movement and flexibility, which is ideal for curved tracks or areas with high wind loads. On the other hand, Rigid systems use a more rigid material for the overhead wires, providing stability and support, making them suitable for straight tracks or areas with heavy loads. Each type has its own advantages and is chosen based on specific project requirements.</p></p>
