<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The α-blocker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-selective Antagonists</li><li>Selective Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-selective α-blockers are drugs that block both α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors, leading to vasodilation and lowering of blood pressure. Selective α-blockers, on the other hand, target only α1 receptors, offering more specific and targeted effects on blood vessels. The market for non-selective α-blockers is typically larger due to their broader mechanism of action, while selective α-blockers are often favored for their reduced side effects and more focused therapeutic benefits.</p></p>
