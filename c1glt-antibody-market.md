<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The C1GLT Antibody Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>pAbs</li><li>mAb</li></ul></p>
<p><p>C1GLT Antibody Market is divided into two main types - polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). pAbs are derived from multiple immune responses and therefore target a variety of epitopes on the C1GLT antigen. They are cheaper to produce but less specific. On the other hand, mAbs are produced by identical immune cells and offer high specificity and consistency in targeting the C1GLT antigen. They are more commonly used in research and therapeutic applications due to their high specificity and purity.</p></p>
