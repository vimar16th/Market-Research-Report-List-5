<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The E-beam Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive E-beam Resists</li><li>Negative E-beam Resists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>E-beam resists are materials used in the microfabrication process to create patterns on a substrate. There are two main types: positive and negative. Positive e-beam resists become more soluble when exposed to an e-beam, allowing the exposed areas to be removed during development. Negative e-beam resists become less soluble when exposed, preserving the exposed areas during development. Both types have their own markets within the semiconductor industry, with positive e-beam resists being more commonly used for high-resolution patterning.</p></p>
